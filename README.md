# klaverjas
A simple QtQuick 2 implementation of the klaverjas game, where I dabble in Monte Carlo search algorithms for the AI players.

## How to install
The game is not really intended to be released, but you can build it by cloning this repository and taking the following steps:

```
cd klaverjas
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
